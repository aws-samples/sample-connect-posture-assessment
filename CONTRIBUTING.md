# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to our project. Whether it's a bug report, new feature, correction, or additional
documentation, we greatly value feedback and contributions from our community.

Please read through this document before submitting any issues or pull requests so that we have all the necessary
information to effectively respond to your bug report or contribution.

## Reporting Bugs/Feature Requests

We welcome you to use the GitHub issue tracker to report bugs or suggest features.

When filing an issue, please check existing open, or recently closed, issues to make sure somebody else hasn't already
reported the issue. Please try to include as much information as you can. Details like these are incredibly useful:

* A reproducible test case or series of steps
* The version of our code being used
* Any modifications you've made relevant to the bug
* Anything unusual about your environment or deployment


## Contributing through Pull Requests
Contributions through pull requests are much appreciated. Before sending us a pull request, make sure that:

1. You are working against the latest source on the *main* branch.
2. You check existing open, and recently merged, pull requests to make sure someone else hasn't addressed the problem already.
3. You open an issue to discuss any significant work - we would hate for your time to be wasted.

To send us a pull request, please:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Modify the source; please focus on the specific change you are contributing. If you also reformat all the code, it will be hard for us to focus on your change.
3. Make sure local tests pass.
4. Run linting, formatting, and tests locally before pushing:
   ```bash
   # Install test dependencies (first time only)
   pip install -e '.[dev,test]'   # ruff, mypy, pytest, moto, hypothesis, boto3

   # Run lint and format checks
   ruff check <changed-files>
   ruff format --check <changed-files>

   # Run unit tests
   python -m pytest tests/ -v
   ```
5. Commit to your fork using clear commit messages.
6. Send us a pull request, answering any default questions in the pull request interface.
7. Pay attention to any automated CI failures reported in the pull request, and stay involved in the conversation.

### Automated CI Checks

The following checks run automatically on every pull request:

- **CI** (`ci.yml`) — `ruff check` (lint) and `ruff format --check` (formatting), `mypy` type-checking, and `pytest` with the coverage gate (`--cov-fail-under=65`), all run across the supported Python matrix; a separate job audits dependencies
- **CloudFormation Lint** (`cfn-lint.yml`) — `cfn-lint` validation of `cloudformation/*.yaml`
- **ASH Security Scan** (`ash-security-scan.yml`, plus a full-repository scan) — [Automated Security Helper](https://github.com/awslabs/automated-security-helper) scans changed files for secrets, dependency vulnerabilities, and IaC misconfigurations

All checks must pass before a pull request can be merged.

GitHub provides additional document on [forking a repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) and
[creating a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).


## Finding contributions to work on
Looking at the existing issues is a great way to find something to contribute on. As our projects, by default, use the default GitHub issue labels (enhancement/bug/duplicate/help wanted/invalid/question/wontfix), looking at any 'help wanted' issues is a great place to start.
